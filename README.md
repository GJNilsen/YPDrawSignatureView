# YPDrawSignatureView

Simple class for capturing signatures.


## Swift 3

The class supports Swift 3.
This branch is not backwards compatible, please download the previous release if you can not support Swift 3. Legacy versions will not be updated anymore.

- Swift 3.0 will be supported
- Swift 2.3 will not be supported


## Usage

Add a new `UIView` where you want the signature capture field. Set its class to `YPDrawSignatureView`, and connect it to an `@IBOutlet` property in your `UIViewController`. For saving and clearing the signature, add two buttons to your view controller. Hook each button up to an `@IBAction` function.

With the view selected, choose the IB Attributes Inspector panel to set custom values, or set them in code where you initialise the signature view.


## New Feature

On ground of popular demand, added signature export as Vector Path in PDF Data Format.


#### Methods

* `clear()`

Clears signature

* `getSignature()`

Returns signature with bounds of YPDrawSignatureView instance

* `getCroppedSignature()`

Returns signature with bounds of signature

*  Ì€getPDFSignature()`
Returns signature as Vector Path PDF Data Format

#### Properties

* `doesContainSignature: Bool`

This is a computed read-only property returning `true` if the view actually contains a signature

* `strokeWidth: CGFloat`

Sets the width of the signature stroke

* `strokeColor: UIColor`

Sets the UIColor of the signature stroke


#### Optional Protocol Methods

* `didStart()`

Notifies the delegate when someone starts a stroke in the view

* `didFinish()`

Notifies the delegate when someone finishes a stroke in the view

#### Example Code

The following sample code checks if there is a signature in the view before getting it.

```
class ViewController: UIViewController, YPSignatureDelegate {
    
    // Connect this Outlet to the Signature View
    @IBOutlet weak var signatureView: YPDrawSignatureView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        
        // Setting this view controller as the signature view delegate, so the didStart() and
        // didFinish() methods below in the delegate section are called.
        signatureView.delegate = self
    }
    
    // Function for clearing the content of signature view
    @IBAction func clearSignature(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // This is how the signature gets cleared
        self.signatureView.clear()
    }
    
    // Function for saving signature
    @IBAction func saveSignature(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // Getting the Signature Image from self.drawSignatureView using the method getSignature().
        if let signatureImage = self.signatureView.getSignature(scale: 10) {
            
            // Saving signatureImage from the line above to the Photo Roll.
            // The first time you do this, the app asks for access to your pictures.
            UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(signatureImage, nil, nil, nil)
            
            // Since the Signature is now saved to the Photo Roll, the View can be cleared anyway.
            self.signatureView.clear()
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - Delegate Methods
    
    // The delegate functions gives feedback to the instanciating class. All functions are optional,
    // meaning you just implement the one you need.
    
    // didStart() is called right after the first touch is registered in the view.
    // For example, this can be used if the view is embedded in a scroll view, temporary
    // stopping it from scrolling while signing.
    func didStart() {
        print("Started Drawing")
    }
    
    // didFinish() is called rigth after the last touch of a gesture is registered in the view.
    // Can be used to enabe scrolling in a scroll view if it has previous been disabled.
    func didFinish() {
        print("Finished Drawing")
    }
}
```
